# Topic Modeling of NYTimes Articles and Comments Using LDA  

## Overview  
This project extracts **New York Times articles and user comments** using the **NYTimes API** and applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling. The goal is to analyze patterns in **news content** and **public discussions**, identifying dominant themes in media coverage and reader perspectives.  

## Methodology  
- Retrieved **NYTimes articles and comments** using the **NYTimes API**.  
- Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Applied **LDA** to uncover latent topics in news and user comments.  
- Visualized topic distributions and key term associations.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **NYTimes API** (Data Extraction)  
- **NLTK, SpaCy** (Text Processing)  
- **Gensim, LDA** (Topic Modeling)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud** (Visualization)
